This is a file I created when I started the FNB App academy. This is basically a website about who Mbali is. Some things are controversial, some may not make any sense because I was just testing out my ability to write a piece of code as someone who did a diploma in Informatics and has never written code.
I created a file about who I am, my interests, and a picture of me.
